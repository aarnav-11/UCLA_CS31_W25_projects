# UCLA CS 31 â€” Winter 2025 Projects

This repository aggregates my CS 31 coursework projects. Each project lives in its own folder within this repo.

## Structure
- `Project_1/`
- `Project_2/`
- `Project 3/`
- `Project_4/`
- `Project_5/`
- Additional practice and support folders: `Hello_2/`, `hello/`, `Tic_Tac_Toe/`, `Test for project 2/`, `SFML/`, `netflix UI/`

Zip archives and build artifacts are ignored via `.gitignore`.

## Build (example)
For simple C++ sources, you can typically build like:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 your_file.cpp -o program && ./program
```

If a project has its own build instructions (Xcode/CMake/Makefile), use those within the specific project folder.
