# UCLA CS 31 â€” Winter 2025 Projects)
This repository aggregates my CS 31 coursework projects for CS31 with Prof. Bruce Huang at UCLA (Winter 2025). Each project lives in its own folder within this repo.

## Structure
- `Project_1/` (100)
- `Project_2/` (100)
- `Project_3/` (97)
- `Project_4/` (97)
- `Project_5/` (70)
- `Project_6/` (100)

Zip archives and build artifacts are ignored via `.gitignore`.

## Build (example)
For simple C++ sources, you can typically build like:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 your_file.cpp -o program && ./program
```

If a project has its own build instructions (Xcode/CMake/Makefile), use those within the specific project folder.

- Do not submit exactly this/copied work as that is against UCLA's policies. This is meant for help and practice not to feed answers
