Report on the errors
Step 5: At first I split the votes at 50% each but instead of giving the output as a draw or no winner, the console would always favour Trump to win with no apparent majority. Also, when I entered a total of 100 voters and made 110 vote for Trump and -10 vote for Harris, the display would show that 110% voted for Trump and -10% for Harris, which is not possible (negative percentages and those beyond 100%). I also tried making a bizzare number of people vote for Trump, like 10,000 but kept the total voters as 100. This made Trump a winner but showed he recieved a percentage higher than 100% in votes- which is not possible.
Logic_error: I just played with the percentage formulae and added replaced the division sign with a plus sign in both cases. Putting 100 expected voters, 80 voting for Harris and 20 for Trump gave 8100% voting for Harris and 2100% voting for Trump.
Compile_error: For the first compile error, I removed the semi-colon from the end of the line "int forHarris". This caused the console to display "expected initializer before 'int'" while referring to the int before Trump. The second compile error was caused by removing the "double" before pctTrump, this caused the program to try to fetch a variable that had not been declared yet and thus display a console message that read: "error: 'pctTrump' was not declared in this scope"
